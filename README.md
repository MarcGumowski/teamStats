**teamStats** implements a small script to scrape team statistics from the web and produce meaningful insights.

In particular, the focus is made on the team of CP Meyrin, playing in the 3rd League of the Swiss Ice Hockey League. Data are scraped directly from the official Swiss Hockey  website: https://www.sihf.ch/fr/regio-league
